That does not necessarily imply &#8216;<em>quiet, peaceful,\u00a0<strong>intuitive<\/strong><\/em>&#8216; personality types. On the contrary, many fire sign people are impulsive in the sense of being given to sudden bursts of action-packed enthusiasm for pursuits or activities they enjoy or believe to be worthwhile.

In extreme situations they may even be considered selfish and egotistical, &#8216;unable to back-down&#8217; when others would prefer them to, which may work-out well or otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>Just like fire itself, people born under the fire signs are sometimes said to be at risk of &#8216;igniting&#8217;, that is suddenly reacting very strongly in ways that may surprise and overwhelm others. For this reason they may be considered emotionally volatile as well as impulsive. Such characteristics might affect individuals only in specific types of situations, or alternatively whenever they feel that their position and authority is being challenged or undermined.<\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What do the astrological fire signs have in common ?
