Through their innate understanding and sympathetic attitudes, they are likely to become open to other people\u2019s problems.<\/p>\n<p>The Moon and Neptune both symbolise the urge to fuse with others around them, and when these planets are combined it heightens sensitivity to the environment, and shows the ability to be kind, caring and comforting towards others.<\/p>\n<p>Many are attracted towards employment in the spheres of social welfare, fostering and care. It is an excellent combination both for the arts and for work in charitable and voluntary areas.<\/p>\n<p>Moon-Neptune may serve deprived people and help the needy in society, but sometimes they can become drained by the demands people make on them.<\/p>\n<p>They may need to examine their need to play saviour or martyr and learn to be more emotionally honest with themselves. The need to be needed can be a powerful motivation, and it leaves them open to being used.<\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Those with the Moon-Neptune aspects possess an emotional sensitivity and vulnerability to others, and an especially powerful impressionable, sympathetic, and psychic empathy.
