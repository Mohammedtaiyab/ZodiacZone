No wonder Piscean people have such a magnetic pull! With its perpetual storms and active climate, Neptune is known for whipping up drama and confusion. It can have a disorienting effect, making it hard to stay in touch with what\u2019s \u201creal.\u201d Neptune personalities are not exactly known for their stellar logical. But compassion? Absolutely! People with a strongly placed Neptune in their chart make great therapists, shamans and healers.<\/p>\n<p>Because of its distance from the Sun, Neptune has a huge orbit to make\u2014it takes 165 years to circle el Sol. Thus, Neptune will linger in a single sign for an average of fifteen years, shaping generations. Divinely inspired creativity comes from Neptune (with some help from\u00a0Venus).

How we relate to mind-altering substances is determined by Neptune. Neptune can dissolve the ego\u2014but this loss of \u201cself\u201d can also provoke a crisis. Hospitals and institutions fall under Neptune\u2019s watch\u2014little surprise since following Neptune\u2019s compass without paying heed to other planets like\u00a0sensible Saturn\u00a0or the self-focused Sun might just get one strapped to the gurney. Like the other outer planets, Neptune goes retrograde annually, for about five months. These periods can be deeply introspective times\u2014but ones that require extra reality checks!<\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The ruler of dreamy, sensitive Pisces, Neptune has the second strongest gravity in the solar system after Jupiter.
